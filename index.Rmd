![Diagram of penguin head with indication of bill length and bill depth.](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/figures/culmen_depth.png){width="523"}

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(reticulate)
penguin_df <- penguins
options(reticulate.repl.quiet = TRUE)
```

The code for this `python` example, has been adapted from an article by [Ekta Sharma](https://towardsdatascience.com/plotly-pandas-for-the-palmer-penguins-f5cdab3c16c8) on the Palmer Penguins dataset.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import os

# add the R df into Python
penguins_df = r.penguin_df
```

### Lets explore the data

Lets take a quick look at the data using `describe()`, this will give us an indication of the variables and their respective
values:

```{python}
penguins_df[["species", "sex", "body_mass_g", "flipper_length_mm", "bill_length_mm"]].dropna().describe(include='all')
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Deeper Dive

Lets take a closer look into the data.

Grouping the penguins according to species demonstrates a particular relationship between weight an flipper length, where Adelie female penguins appear
to be the lightest and have the shortest flippers.

```{python, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
(penguins_df
.dropna()
.groupby(["species", "sex"])
.agg({"body_mass_g": "mean", "flipper_length_mm": "mean", "sex": "count"})
.sort_index()
)
```

It seems that the _Gentoo_ is the largest penguin species. We can also 
take a closer look at their distribution along with the overall 
distribution:

```{python}
larger = penguins_df[penguins_df.species=="Gentoo"].dropna()
larger
```


### Plot Section

Let's move on to some plots,this time using ggplot for visualising the
overall distribution of body mass for the Gentoo species:

```{r}
penguin_plot <- py$larger %>% 
filter(!is.na(sex)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(body_mass_g, fill = sex)) + 
  geom_density(color = "white", alpha = 0.5) +
   scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple")) +
  labs(x = "Body Mass (g)")+
  theme_minimal()

 penguin_plot
```
